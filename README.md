## Work Experience
**WHK/SHK (Research Assistant) @ Vodafone Chair Mobile Communication Systems (_May 2023 - Present_)**
- Data preprocessing and building deep learning models for Access Interval Prediction of memory accesses in Hardware Accelerators in Tensorflow.
- Built scripts for Quantization Aware Training (QAT) for lower bit-widths i.e. <8 bits, using Pytorch, simulating their behavior using FakeQuantization.

**Engineer/Associate Engineer @ LnT Technology Services (_Jan 2021 - Aug 2022_)**
- Performing standardization across Wind Turbine architecture using Interface Management methodology.
- Collection of interface/module data and generation of Design Structure Matrix (DSM) using Cambridge Advanced Modeler. Classification of interfaces based on criticality and clustering of turbine modules for standardized change management.
- Built my tool using Python to form the DSM using a correlation matrix and analyse the functionality between 
- Automated the scraping and extracting of data from Windchill using Selenium (automation) and built an interactive dashboard to help analyze and visualize data for validation in Power BI.

**Automotive Research Intern @ Gannet Engineering Pvt. Ltd. (_Jan 2020 to May 2020_)**
- Collection of engine testing points using Latin Hypercube Sampling, Box-Behnkehn, and other DoE methods.
- Generated models for engine emissions (NOx and Soot) using regression analysis and Machine learning techniques.
- The generated models were compared with an aim of selecting the model below 10% error rate
- Optimization of emissions trade-off using Cal-G software.
- Development of GUI for Electronic Control Unit using Raptor Model-Based Development

**Mechanical Head, DY. Project Manager @ ThrustMIT, Manipal Academy of Higher Education’s Rocketry team (_Sep 2017 - Aug 2019_)**
- Design, Analysis & Fabrication of Sounding Rocket for Spaceport America 2019, New Mexico, USA
- Led a team of 24 members as the Mechanical Head and Deputy Project Manager for the event
##### Subprojects:
- Design, analysis, and manufacturing of structural components like bulkheads using CATIA and ANSYS
- Fabrication of Rocket fuselage and tube couplers using Composite materials.
- Developing a custom ejection system for parachute deployment.

**Project Intern @ Schaeffler Pvt. Ltd. (_Jun 2018  - July 2018_)**
- Used PFEP methodology as part of Lean strategy to create a comparative time study for Trugger, kit building, and supplier packaging of bearings.
