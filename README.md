## Work Experience
**Engineer/Associate Engineer @ LnT Technology Services (_Jan 2021 - Aug 2022_)**
- Performing standardization across Wind Turbine architecture using Interface Management methodology.
- Collection of interface/module data and generation of Design Structure Matrix (DSM) using Cambridge Advanced Modeler. Classification of interfaces based on criticality and clustering of turbine modules for standardized change management.
- Built my tool using Python to form the DSM using a correlation matrix and analyse the functionality between 
- Automated the scraping and extracting of data from Windchill using Selenium (automation) and built an interactive dashboard to help analyze and visualize data for validation in Power BI.

**Automotive Research Intern @ Gannet Engineering Pvt. Ltd. (_Jan 2020 to May 2020_)**
- Collection of engine testing points using Latin Hypercube Sampling, Box-Behnkehn, and other DoE methods.
- Generated models for engine emissions (NOx and Soot) using regression analysis and Machine learning techniques.
- The generated models were compared with an aim of selecting the model below 10% error rate
- Optimization of emissions trade-off using Cal-G software.
